[DONE] OBSERVER
--------

Putting information on two parts of the code is prone to bugs.

Event Button ---> CONTROLLER ---> MODEL ---> update ---> note ---> VIEW ---> gets MODEL ---> repaint()

- A button is pushed.
- Callback function (controller) is called.
- Something on gameEvent (facade) is called.
- The Model is modified
- gameState's update() notify every view.
- View gets updated info from gameState.
- view calls repaint()

TODOs
-----
1) When a player needs to pay rent (company or land) and doesn't have money, the game must ask the player which lands/companies to sell. Repeat until the player has enought money. If this is not sufficient set player.bankrupt to true. Antenor/Wolff
2) [DONE] There are some events that the callback class is declared in-place. It's better to move these classes to Controller. Antenor
3) [DONE] Use the observer. Karl. 
4) Record the video. Everyone.
5) Finish tests cases of model. Wolff
6) Write fourth report. Wolff.
